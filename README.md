#FYI
If you are getting an error in Visual Studio saying file path is too long, then this can be solved by upating your version of npm 'npm install -g npm'.

If you cannot see package.json in your solution explorer, select the project in solution explorer. 
Then click the 'Show all files' button located to the right of 'Collapse all', you will then see the package.json. 
You can right click on and select 'Show in solution explorer' and it will always show up. Now you can unselect 'Show all files'.
